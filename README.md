As part of practice, all the projects that I have worked on are presented here. These are based on most challenges on Competitive Coding Websites. 

1. TicTacToeApplication: An AI vs User Input simple Java Application for Tic Tac Toe. It was built as part of a HackerRank Challenge
2. RotateArrayLeft: A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. Given an array of  integers and a number, perform 3 left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
