As part of practice, all the projects that I have worked on are presented here. These are based on most challenges on Competitive Coding Websites. 

1. TicTacToeApplication: An AI vs User Input simple Java Application for Tic Tac Toe. On compile and run, the tool will help you play Tic Tac Toe with an AI.
2. RotateArrayLeft: A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. Given an array of  integers and a number, perform 3 left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
3. Ransom Note: Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.
4. Balanced Brackets: Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and (). Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, print YES on a new line; otherwise, print NO on a new line.
5. Is This a Binary Search Tree?: Given the root node of a binary tree, can you determine if it's also a binary search tree?
